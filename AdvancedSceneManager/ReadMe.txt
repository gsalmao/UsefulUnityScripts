This is the AdvancedSceneManager. It allows you to load a scene,
set its additive scenes, set the active scene through the SO and
a few more settings, such as reload repeated additive scenes or not.


The script does not include FadeIn/FadeOut, LoadingScreens or anything else,
it is plain and pure Unload/Load Scenes and set them, thus making it very
easy to implement. =]
